About me:

I am a recent graduate of the HDip in Software Development from Atlantic Technological University, (ATU). 

I am also a visual artist with a BA(Hons) in Fine Art from Crawford, (MTU).
A career as an artist let me develop excellent communication skills, understanding client needs, working self-sufficiently and being innovative.
