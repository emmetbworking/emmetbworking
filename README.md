A little bit about me:

I am soon to be graduating with a HDip in Software Development from Atlantic Technological University, (ATU). 
My skills include 
JavaScript, 
TypeScript, 
CSS, HTML5,

Knowledge of database systems such as SQL. 


Currently studying advanced JavaScript and React via Scrimba.
I will upload projects here as I work through the course.
