About me:

I'm a recent graduate of the HDip in Software Development from Atlantic Technological University, (ATU). 
While looking for a role, I've joined the Creative Snails developer team to gain experience. In this open-source team, we have weekly standup meetings and one of the team is always there to help through Slack. 
I'm delighted to receive the mentorship to guide me through best practices and point me in the right direction, while also giving me exposure to real review processes.

I am also a visual artist with a BA(Hons) in Fine Art from Crawford, (MTU).
A career as an artist let me develop excellent communication skills, understanding client needs, working self-sufficiently, and building on my passion for design.
